        <div class="part">
            <p> Samhitha Crop Care Clinics supply farmers with Precision Farming Advisory. It is a process where crops are under continuous surveillance by a team of qualified and experienced agri-professionals. The Precision Advisory Platform consists of wireless devices which collect soil moisture, soil temperature, soil pH, EC, weather data, information about pests and diseases. Samhitha studies the data and creates detailed recommendations to give. </p>

        <div class="part">
            <p> The field information is formatted effectively to be displayed as text, image, audio, and/or video so that you can view and interpret it easily.  </p>
        </div>

        <div class="part">
            <p> Samhitha uses harvest monitoring which consists of precision farming and   smart crop monitoring technologies (which involve remote sensing, data-driven insights, and physical monitoring). This allows for the team to study the crops and analyze real-time data. </p>
            <ul> 
                <li>This technology also forms a detailed report regarding crop growth and health that helps you on when to intervene, if necessary</li>
                <li>They help you to optimize harvesting windows to for the most crop yield </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Samhitha developed this technology on their own and ensures that this process results in high quality and quantity of crop yield and higher profitability. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="part">
            <p> Samhitha uses the latest technologies that were developed, like IoT, Drones, Mobile Apps, and more, but also in-house expert crop advisory to provide services. Samhitha uses a combination to maximize the help they can provide. Like the engineers build customized telemetry devices but also use world-class sensors to capture soil and weather data. </p>
            
        </div>

        <div class="part">
            <p> Samhitha builds customized algorithms for detecting diseases, which enables them to create irrigation schedules and disease outbreak alerts for each of the unique problems that were reported from the data they collected of trees. </p>
