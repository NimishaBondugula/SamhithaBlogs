            <h3> ఒక రైతుగా మీరు అగ్రిటెక్ గురించి ఎందుకు తెలుసుకోవాలి? </h3>
            <p> According to the US Department of Agriculture [USDA], implementing AgriTech into farming can be incredibly beneficial to have higher crop productivity, sustainably reducing the harmful impact on the environment, and prevent chemical runoff into rivers and groundwater. You can also increase the safety of workers, decrease the use of water and keep food prices down by using less water, fertilizer, and pesticides because you "no longer have to apply [these pricey resources] uniformly across entire fields. Instead, they can use the minimum quantities required and target very specific areas, or even treat individual plants differently". Things you wouldn't have imagined could be done a few decades ago are now available to upgrade and can revolutionize the way you work and live. As a farmer, half the outcome of your crops may not be in your hands. AgriTechnology can help you figure out exactly what you should do to have the healthiest, most fruitful yield every single year using data and science to your benefit even with no experience.</p>

            <h3> ఎప్పుడు మొదలైంది? (చరిత్ర) </h3>
            <p>"Agritech is as old as the first wheel, the first implement that helped utilize cattle as power for cultivation". Over time the industry evolved through developments like tractors in the 19th century and hydraulics even earlier. Only recently have new inventions such as modified seeds, GPS trackers, solar panels, and temperature systems risen, and the industry is now valued at $7.8 trillion (₹646,121,970,000,000) industry with investments reaching $2.6 billion (₹215,250,230,000).</p>

            <h3> నేడు ప్రధాన పోటీదారులు ఎవరు? </h3>
            <p>Although this industry has left its mark and continues to grow throughout the world, let's focus on its prominence in India. There are a few phases in how AgriTech in India came to be, according to Forbes. From 2010-16 (the first phase) many were skeptical about the possible impacts to the ecosystem introducing digital tools to farmers could bring. Big companies during this time included Cropin, BigHaat, DeHaat, Stellapps, and Innoterra. Phase two began in 2017 when large tech companies began entering into the AgriTech space, and in just 4 years the number of viable startups skyrocketed to 1,500+.</p>

            <h3> ఒక రైతుగా మీకు ఇది ఎలా ఉపయోగపడుతుంది? </h3>
            <p>Agri Technologies can benefit your health by making your job less physically intensive every day. It can benefit your environment by using up less water, pesticides, and other harmful products. It can benefit your family and children when you have guaranteed success in harvesting. "The adoption of agritech solutions soared with improved data access and smartphone penetration in villages" according to Forbes, which shows that innovation can even benefit your village and community by bringing advancements that you wouldn't have access to otherwise. With all of the benefits that AgriTech shows, there is no reason not to reach out for these opportunities as a farmer!</p>
